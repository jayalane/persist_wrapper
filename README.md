A few tools to make it easier for me to read and write various data to
sqlite3 DBs.  Generally, I'm using data that has the same structure
each day, but the structure might evolve over the course of the
project.  Generally, the data is extremely expensive to calculate, and
I want to save all my intermediate results.

Please feel free to contact me about this.
